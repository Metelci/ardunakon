What's New in v0.1.7-alpha:

?? **UNO R4 WiFi + Clones**:
    **Dual BLE Profile**: R4 WiFi sketch now advertises both ArduinoBLE default (19B10000/19B10001) and HM-10 UUIDs so official boards and BLE-capable clones connect natively.
    **Docs Updated**: Setup guide and compatibility matrix explicitly cover R4 WiFi clone support and dual-UUID advertising.
    **Attribution Fixed**: All Arduino sketches now point to github.com/Metelci/ardunakon.
?? **HC-06 on Xiaomi/MIUI**:
    **OEM Reflection Fallback**: Automatically enables Reflection Port 1 on Xiaomi/Redmi/Poco devices when SPP fails, fixing HC-06 connects on MIUI/Android 12+.

What's New in v0.1.6-alpha:

🎮 **RC Car Control Layout**:
   • **Left Joystick → Throttle**: Now controls RC motor with vertical-only movement, no horizontal drift
   • **Right Joystick → WASD Buttons**: Replaced with discrete servo control buttons (Up/Down/Left/Right)
   • **Throttle Behavior**: Non-centering Y-axis stays at last position for smooth RC car speed control
   • **Instant Servo Control**: WASD buttons provide full deflection on tap for precise steering/pan-tilt

🔄 **Auto-Reconnect Toggle Buttons**:
   • **Manual Control**: Added toggle buttons next to Dev 1 and Dev 2 for disabling auto-reconnect per device
   • **Symmetrical Layout**: Toggles placed on opposite sides of status cards for clean, balanced appearance
   • **36dp Size**: Matched to status card height for visual consistency
   • **Persistent State**: Auto-reconnect preferences saved across app restarts

🔧 **BLE GATT Connection Improvements**:
   • **Error 147 Handling**: Added intelligent retry logic for BLE link layer failures
   • **Transient Error Detection**: Classifies GATT errors (8, 129, 147) as retry-able vs permanent (133)
   • **Exponential Backoff**: 2s → 4s → 6s delays before marking connection as failed
   • **Better Diagnostics**: Human-readable error messages (e.g., "Link Layer Failure: Device reset or interference")
   • **Device Name Resolution**: Fixed "Connecting to null" logs, always shows device name or MAC address
   • **Pre-flight Checks**: Verifies Bluetooth adapter state with 500ms settling delay

📡 **Device Name Improvements**:
   • **Cache Refresh**: Device names refreshed in debug window on every connection attempt
   • **Android 12+ Compatibility**: Multi-layer name resolution ensures names display correctly on all devices
   • **Scan Window**: Device names always show correctly in Bluetooth device scan list

🎨 **UI Polish**:
   • **Compact Labels**: Reduced font sizes for control labels (Throttle/Servos) to accommodate debug panel
   • **Lowercase WASD**: Changed "(WASD)" to "(wasd)" to prevent line wrapping
   • **Better Spacing**: Optimized padding (12dp → 8dp) for cleaner layout with debug window open
   • **Menu Clarification**: "Legacy Reflection Connect" renamed to "Legacy Reflection (HC-06)" for clarity

🛠️ **Technical Stability**:
   • Circuit breaker pattern prevents connection hammering (10 attempt limit)
   • Enhanced GATT cleanup: disconnect() → 200ms delay → close()
   • Improved mutex handling prevents connection storms
   • Reset backoff counters on successful GATT connection

Previous Release - v0.1.5-alpha:

🔒 **Bluetooth Connectivity Improvements**:
   • **Bounded Write Queue**: Added 100-packet capacity limit for BLE connections to prevent memory growth during connectivity issues
   • **3-Strike Retry Logic**: Classic Bluetooth now tolerates up to 3 consecutive read errors before disconnecting, improving resilience against transient interference
   • **Enhanced Write Error Handling**: Write failures now properly trigger reconnection instead of silent failure
   • **Optimized BLE Timeout**: Extended connection timeout to 15 seconds for better compatibility with slower BLE modules (HC-08, HM-10 clones)

🕹️ **Joystick Control Enhancements**:
   • **Auto-Centering**: Both joysticks now automatically return to center when released for more precise control
   • **Clear Labeling**: Added descriptive labels - "Movement (Servos)" for left stick and "Throttle (Speed)" for right stick
   • **Side Labels**: Labels now appear beside joysticks for better visibility and cleaner layout
   • **Perfect Alignment**: Joysticks now properly centered in their respective screen halves

🎨 **UI Polish**:
   • **Help Icon**: Replaced three-dot menu with friendly question mark (?) icon for easier recognition
   • **Improved Layout**: Better spacing and arrangement throughout control screen

🛠️ **Technical Stability**:
   • Enhanced connection mutex system to prevent connection storms
   • Improved resource cleanup in all failure scenarios
   • Better error logging for diagnostic purposes

Previous Release - v0.1.4-alpha:

🎨 **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   • **Fullscreen Optimization**: Fixed layout to properly respect system notification bar and navigation buttons - no more overlapping UI elements!
   • **Centered Control Layout**: Reorganized E-STOP, signal indicators, and control buttons into a clean centered layout for better visibility and balance.
   • **Electric Yellow Device Buttons**: Dev 1 and Dev 2 status buttons now use bright electric yellow for instant visibility.
   • **Streamlined Interface**: Removed redundant Bluetooth icons and optimized joystick alignment for a cleaner look.
   • **Theme Toggle Relocated**: Theme switcher moved to top bar alongside Bluetooth and menu buttons for easier access.

🎯 **Layout Improvements**:
   • **Perfect Joystick Alignment**: Both joysticks now align perfectly at the same height with labels consistently positioned below.
   • **Centered Slot Info**: Slot 1 and Slot 2 information displayed side-by-side at center for better readability.
   • **Optimized Spacing**: Improved icon positioning throughout the app for better visual balance.

🛠️ **Technical Updates**:
   • Enabled edge-to-edge display with proper WindowInsets handling
   • Applied safe drawing padding to prevent system UI overlap
   • Cleaned up code warnings and improved build efficiency
