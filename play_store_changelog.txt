What's New in v0.1.5-alpha:

🔒 **Bluetooth Connectivity Improvements**:
   • **Bounded Write Queue**: Added 100-packet capacity limit for BLE connections to prevent memory growth during connectivity issues
   • **3-Strike Retry Logic**: Classic Bluetooth now tolerates up to 3 consecutive read errors before disconnecting, improving resilience against transient interference
   • **Enhanced Write Error Handling**: Write failures now properly trigger reconnection instead of silent failure
   • **Optimized BLE Timeout**: Extended connection timeout to 15 seconds for better compatibility with slower BLE modules (HC-08, HM-10 clones)

   • **Clear Labeling**: Added descriptive labels - "Movement (Servos)" for left stick and "Throttle (Speed)" for right stick
   • **Side Labels**: Labels now appear beside joysticks for better visibility and cleaner layout
   • **Perfect Alignment**: Joysticks now properly centered in their respective screen halves

🎨 **UI Polish**:
   • **Help Icon**: Replaced three-dot menu with friendly question mark (?) icon for easier recognition
   • **Improved Layout**: Better spacing and arrangement throughout control screen

🛠️ **Technical Stability**:
   • Enhanced connection mutex system to prevent connection storms
   • Improved resource cleanup in all failure scenarios
   • Better error logging for diagnostic purposes
